After several attemps on blogging. Here I'm trying to have consistent
blog for both personal and business related reason. Before that I build
my own site from scratch on my own raspberry pi based server,
I build another one on Wordpress etc. As you can see from this site none
of them become successfull.

On the other hand, I have really good reasons to have blog. I learned 
almost everythink that I know thanks to internet. While I'm learning all
of these I feel like I have to pay back. Since I'm not the guy who has no
interest on one to one teaching. Blog posts can be very helpful for me.

Besides that when we think about my professional career. I'm trying to 
become digital nomad as software engineer. So if I'm going to take my 
business to whole another level while digitazing it totally. I have to
known, at least can be known, in digital world. So blogging can be very
helpful for that also.

So here we go. It's Cagatay, I'm a passionate software developer who is
trying to become problem solver. I'm trying use technology to solve problems.
I'm comfortable with playing around on Linux. I like Python, bash, vim, tmux
and VSCode. Feel free to reach me about more!
